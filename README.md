#ChessBot

ChessBot is an innovative miniature chess prototype designed to combine physical and digital gameplay. The system utilizes a 2x2 chessboard with embedded buttons to track piece placement and removal, displaying real-time updates on a VGA monitor. The ChessBot is powered by a DE2-115 FPGA board and integrates GPIO inputs to detect piece positions and corresponding VGA output to display those positions on a screen.
